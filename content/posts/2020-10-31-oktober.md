This October must have been the least productive month of this year (to me).

- Earlier this month, I made a Twitter bot [@canberramapbot](https://twitter.com/canberramapbot) that posts random bird's-eye views over Canberra with GitHub Actions. It's buggy sometimes, but it actually works. The repo is [here](https://github.com/rexarski/canberramapbot).
- Finished reading two books:
  - [Rework](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6732019-rewok) by Jason Fried and David H. Hansson.
  - [Text Mining with R: A Tidy Approach](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) by Julia Silge and David Robinson.
  - Those two are definitely "the ones that I should've read earlier". One before this job, one before that [Hackathon](/post/2020-09-26-hackathon/).
- Currently reading [Artemis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34928122-artemis) by Andy Weir. I might not like this one as *The Martian*. Kinda expectable.
- Had a swollen lymph node on my neck since the beginning of October after a spicy meal. The swollen persisted for a week before I went to see a doctor. Some rounds of examinations later, money spent, no conclusion drawn but definitely had some rough ideas about it. The symptoms are almost gone from my angle though.
- And that directly counteracted my productivity since I was consistently feeling unwell. I postponed the AWS CCP test to next month, but good thing is I've almost done my review so far.
- Set up a personal cloud storage with Nextcloud but deactivated later. Hey, I don't even know what to put there, just not as useful as I expected.
- Heard Cyberpunk 2077 would be delayed to a December 10th launch date. Duh!

Hopefully November would treat me well.
